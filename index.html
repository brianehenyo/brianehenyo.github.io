        <h3>ABOUT BRIANE</h3>
        <p>
            Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the Graduate School of Systems Information Science at 
            <a href="https://www.fun.ac.jp/en/">Future University Hakodate</a>, Japan. I am a Japanese Government (MEXT) scholar under the supervision of
            <a href="http://www.fun.ac.jp/~sumi/">Prof. Yasuyuki Sumi</a> at the Interaction Media Lab. 
            I specialize in the integration of human-computer interaction and complex systems research in creating civic solutions. 

            Concurrently, I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the College of Computer Studies at <a href="https://www.dlsu.edu.ph/">De La Salle University</a> in the Philippines.
            I founded the <a href="http://comet.dlsu.edu.ph">Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET)</a> and is now the head of its Civic Services group.
        </p>

        <h4>Research Program</h4>
        <p>
            My research program explores novel navigation and wayfinding applications for connected drivers and commuters.
            The goal is to develop navigation and wayfinding solutions that can influence the mobility
            patterns of commuters and connected drivers towards more livable and sustainable cities.
            It is focused on three equally particular approaches: 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>understanding the practices of connected drivers and commuters, and the human factors behind their navigation and wayfinding decisions; </li>
            <li>exploring novel and persuasive interaction techniques, data visualization, and information architecture that promotes altruistic, 
                purposeful, and effective driving navigation and commuter wayfinding; and</li>
            <li>creating agent-based models to understand how these designs and techniques can affect urban mobility and the system-wide performance of road networks. </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            My secondary interests revolve around creating reflective spaces, understanding collaboration and social networks, and developing civic solutions for mobility, transportation, and disaster awareness and preparedness.
