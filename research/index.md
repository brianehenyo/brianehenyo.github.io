## Altruistic Navigation

Recent advancements in computer vision, reinforcement learning and automated driving has fueled experts towards a fully automated driving future. But while that seems to be the direction of automotive research, we cannot deny the fact that My PhD research program explores novel navigation and wayfinding applications for connected drivers and commuters. The goal is to develop navigation and wayfinding solutions that can influence the mobility patterns of commuters and connected drivers towards more livable and sustainable cities. It is focused on three equally particular approaches: 
- understanding the practices of connected drivers and commuters, and the human factors behind their navigation and wayfinding decisions;
- exploring novel and persuasive interaction techniques, data visualization, and information architecture that promotes altruistic, purposeful, and effective driving navigation and commuter wayfinding; and
- creating agent-based models to understand how these designs and techniques can affect urban mobility and the system-wide performance of road networks.
